# Chip8
A Chip-8 interpreter I made in C# and SDL2.

Note: This emulator is not 100% perfect. 
Audio does not work. It fails some of the flags test.
Not all games work. 

I have moved onto coding other emulators.

That being said, Chip8 is a great starting point to emulation development and worth trying out, especially because of how little opcodes they are.
